# **Exercises**

1. Given two statements, x = 3; and y = 5 + x;, how can you build a statement block with the two statements?
*Answer*
int numbers( int x, int y)
{
int sumi
x = 3; 
y = 5;
sum = x + y;
return sum;
}

2. What is wrong with the following function?
int 3integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
{
int sum;
sum = x + y + z;
return sum;
}
*Answer*
There is a number infront of the function 3integer_add.

3. What is wrong with the following function?
int integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
{
int sum;
sum = x + y + z
return sum;
}
*Answer*
There is no semicolon after the statement sum.

4. Write a C function that can perform a multiplication of two integers and return the calculated result.
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
 /* This function multiplies two integers and returns the result */
int integer_mul( int x, int y )
{
    int result;
    result = x * y;
    return result;
}

5. Write a C program that calls the C function you just wrote in Exercise 4 to calculate the multiplication of 3 times 5 and then print out the return value fromthe function on the screen.
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
 /* This function multiplies two integers and returns the result */
int integer_mul( int x, int y )
{
    int result;
    result = x * y;
    return result;
}

int main()
{
    int product;
    product = integer_mul(3, 5);
    printf("The product is %d.\n", product);
    return 0;
}
