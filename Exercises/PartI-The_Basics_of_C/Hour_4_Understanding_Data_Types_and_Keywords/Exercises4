1. Write a program that prints out the numeric values of characters Z and z.
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char c1;
    char c2;

    c1 = 'z';
    c2 = 'Z';
    printf("The numeric value for Z is %d.\n", c1);
    printf("The numeric value of z is %d.\n", c2;
	return 0;
}

2. Given two numeric values, 72 and 104, write a program to print out the corresponding two characters.
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    char c1;
    char c2;

    c1 = 104;
    c2 = 72;

    printf("The character for 104 is %c.\n", c1);
    printf("The character for 72 is %c.\n", c2);
	return 0;
}

3. For a 16-bit integer variable, can you assign the variable with an integer value of 72368?
*Answer*

No. 72368 is beyond the range of the int data type of 16 bits. If you assign a value
that is too large for the data type, the resulting value will wrap around and the
result will be incorrect.

4. Given the declaration double dbl_num = 123.456;, write a program that prints out the value of dbl_num in both floating-point and scientific notation formats.
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    double dbl_num;
    dbl_num = 123.456;

    printf("Value of dbl_num in floating-point is %f.\n", dbl_num);
    printf("Value of dbl_num in scientific notation is %e.\n", dbl_num);
	return 0;
}

5. Write a program that can print out the numeric value of the newline character (\n).

(Hint: assign ‘\n’ to a character variable.)
*Answer*
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char ch;
	
	ch = '\n';

    printf("The numeric value for newline is %d.\n", ch);
	return 0;

}
