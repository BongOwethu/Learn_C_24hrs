*Q:* What is the difference between the pre-increment operator and the post-increment operator?
*A:* The pre-increment operator increases the operandâ€™s value by 1 first, and then yields the modified value. On the other hand, the post-increment operator yields the original value of its operand first, then increments the operand. For instance, given x = 1, the ++x expression yields 2, whereas the expression x++ evaluates to 1 before actually modifying x.

*Q:* Is the unary minus operator (-) the same as the subtraction operator (-)?
*A:* No, they are not the same, although the two operators share the same symbol. The meaning of the symbol is determined by the context in which it appears. The unary
minus operator is used to change the sign of a numeric value. In other words, the unary minus operator yields the negation of the value. The subtraction operator is an arithmetic operator that performs a subtraction between its two operands.

*Q:* Which one has a higher precedence, a relational operator or an arithmetic operator?
*A:* An arithmetic operator has a higher precedence than a relational operator. For instance, in the expression x * y + z > x + y,the operator precedence from highest to lowest goes from * to + and finally >. The entire expression is therefore interpreted as ((x * y) + z) > (x + y).

*Q:* What value is yielded by a relational expression?
*A:* A relational expression evaluates to either 0 or 1. If the relation indicated bly a relational operator in an expression is true, the expression evaluates to 1; otherwise, the expression evaluates to 0.
