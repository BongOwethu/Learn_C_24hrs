# **Summary**
In this lesson you learned the following important concepts and statements:
• Looping can be used to perform the same set of statements over and over until specified conditions are met.
• Looping makes your program more concise.
• There are three statements, while, and do-while, and for, that are used for looping in C.
• The while statement contains one expression, which is the conditional expression which controls the loop.
• The while statement does not end with a semicolon.
• The do-while statement places its conditional expression at the bottom of the loop.
• The do-while statement ends with a semicolon.
• There are three expressions in the for statement. The second expression is the conditional expression.
• The for statement does not end with a semicolon.
• Multiple expressions, combined via commas, can be used as one expression in the for statement.
• In a nested loop, inner loop finishes before the outer loop resumes its iteration in nested loops.
