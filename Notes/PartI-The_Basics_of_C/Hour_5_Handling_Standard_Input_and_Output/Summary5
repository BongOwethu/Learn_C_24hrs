# **Summary**
In this lesson you’ve learned the following important concepts, specifiers, and functions:
• The C language treats a file as a series of bytes.
• stdin, stdout, and stderr are three file streams that are pre-opened and always available for you to use.
• The C library functions getc() and getchar() can be used to read in one character from the standard input.
• The C library functions putc() and putchar() can be used to write one character to the standard output.
• %x or %X can be used to convert decimal numbers to hex numbers.
• A minimum field width can be specified and ensured by adding an integer into a format specifier.
• An output can be aligned at either the left or right edge of the output field.
• A precision specifier can be used to specify the decimal place number for floatingpoint numbers, or the maximum field width for integers or strings.
